## What is OSX-screenlock

It's a screenlock design work on OSX.


## Why I do this

I think user should use music player when the screen is locked. So I redesign the interface to combine player and screenlock. The song I choose is one of my favorite **This is What it Feels Like** by Armin van Buuren.
